# Creative Coding with Bruno Imbrizi

An excellent course, very glad I purchased it and completed it. Well worth my time and money.

All my sketches (using the excellent [canvas-sketch](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch)) are located in src/routes/ as js files. If you want to work with images, create an 'assets' folder there and replace the image filenames you see in sketch-05.js with your own.

Also added three more files created by fellow student [ddddd](https://www.domestika.org/en/ddddd), as seen in his [final project.](https://www.domestika.org/en/projects/1338175-mi-proyecto-del-curso-codificacion-creativa-crea-piezas-visuales-con-javascript)

## Sveltekit
I'm in the process of adapting these sketches into Svelte components in a Sveltekit build.
