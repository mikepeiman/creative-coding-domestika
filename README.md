# Creative Coding with Bruno Imbrizi

An excellent course, very glad I purchased it and completed it. Well worth my time and money.

All my sketches (using the excellent [canvas-sketch](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch)) are located in src/routes/creative. If you want to work with images, create an 'assets' folder there and replace the filenames you see in sketch-05.js
