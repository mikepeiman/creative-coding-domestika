<div>&quot;The only foundation for . . . a republic is to be laid in Religion. Without this there can be no virtue, and
  without virtue there can be no liberty, and liberty is the object and life of all republican governments.&quot; -

<div>&quot;Unless we put medical freedom into the Constitution, the time will come when medicine will organize into an

<div>&quot;If the Age Of Enlightenment has brought forth anything, then certainly this: NEVER take anything any
  government tells you at face value. ALWAYS question everything any government does or does not do. Always look for
  ulterior motives, and always ask 'Cui bono?' Who benefits?&quot; - Christine Anderson, German MEP</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>&quot;Whenever a government claims to have the people's interests at heart, you need to think again. In the entire

<div>&quot;It is not for nothing that our age cries out for the redeemer personality; for the one who can emancipate
  himself from the grip of the collective psychosis and save at least his own soul, who lights a beacon of hope for

<div>&quot;Fortunately, some are born with spiritual immune systems that sooner or later give rejection to the illusory
  worldview grafted upon them from birth through social conditioning. They begin sensing that something is amiss, and
  start looking for answers. Inner knowledge and anomalous outer experiences show them a side of reality others are
  oblivious to, and so begins their journey of awakening. Each step of the journey is made by following the heart
  instead of following the crowd and by choosing knowledge over the veils of ignorance.&quot; - Henri Bergson</div>

<div>&quot;Truth has to be repeated constantly, because Error also is being preached all the time, and not just by a

<div>&quot;Our freedom to doubt was born out of a struggle against authority in the early days of science. It was a very
  deep and strong struggle: permit us to question - to doubt - to not be sure. I think that it is important that we do
  not forget this struggle and thus perhaps lose what we have gained.&quot; - Richard Feynman</div>

<div>&quot;When he recites his propaganda lesson and says that he is thinking for himself, when his eyes see nothing and
  his mouth only produces sounds previously stenciled into his brain, when he says that he is indeed expressing his

<div>&quot;Indeed, it is becoming ever more obvious that it is not famine, not earthquakes, not microbes, not

<div>&quot;. . .the totalitarian systems of the 20th century represent a kind of collective psychosis. Whether gradually
  or
  suddenly, reason and common human decency are no longer possible in such a system: there is only a pervasive
  atmosphere of terror, and a projection of &ldquo;the enemy&rdquo;, imagined to be &ldquo;in our midst&rdquo;. Thus
  society turns on itself,
  urged on by the ruling authorities.&quot; - Joost Meerloo [The Rape of the Mind]</div>

<div>&quot;The telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously... There was of course no way of knowing whether you

<div>&quot;Without critical thinking people would be more easily exploited not only politically but economically.
  Critical thinking employed by an informed citizenry is a necessary condition for the success of democratic
  institutions and for competitive free-market economic enterprise. These values are so important that it is in the

  their personal good, but for the good of the rest of us too.&quot; - Peter A. Facione</div>

<div>&quot;It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the

<div>&quot;The medical profession is being bought by the pharmaceutical industry, not only in terms of the practice of

<div><br /></div>
<div>&quot;The case against science is straightforward: much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be
  untrue. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant
  conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has
  taken a turn towards darkness. (...) Part of the problem is that no-one is incentivised to be right. Instead,
  scientists are incentivised to be productive and innovative.&quot; - Richard Horton, Editor-In-Chief of The Lancet

<div>&quot;The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to

<div>&quot;The urge to save humanity is almost always only a false-face for the urge to rule it. Power is what all
  messiahs

<div><br /></div>
<div>&quot;People do not expect to find chastity in a house of ill repute. Why, then, do they expect to find honesty and
  humanity in government, a congeries of institutions whose modus operandi consists of lying, cheating, stealing, and if
  need be, murdering those who resist?&quot; - H. L. Mencken</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>&quot;Whenever the government of the United States shall break up, it will probably be in consequence of a false
  direction having been given to public opinion. This is the weak point of our defenses, and the part to which the
  enemies of the system will direct all their attacks. Opinion can be so perverted as to cause the false to seem true;
  the enemy, a friend, and the friend, an enemy; the best interests of the nation to appear insignificant, and trifles
  of moment; in a word, the right the wrong, and the wrong, the right. In a country where opinion has sway, to seize
  upon it, is to seize upon power. As it is a rule of humanity that the upright and well-intentioned are comparatively
  passive, while the designing, dishonest and selfish are the most untiring in their efforts, the danger of public
  opinion’s getting a false direction is four-fold, since few men think for themselves.&quot; - James Fenimore Cooper
  [The
  American Democrat, 1838]</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>&quot;So the final conclusion would surely be that whereas other civilizations have been brought down by attacks of
  barbarians from without, ours had the unique distinction of training its own destroyers at its own educational

  the public expense.&quot; - Malcolm Muggeridge</div>

<div>&quot;Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It

  be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes

<div>&quot;The most brilliant propagandist technique will yield no success unless one fundamental principle is borne in

<div>&quot;To be a socialist is to submit the I to the thou; socialism is sacrificing the individual to the whole.&quot;
  - Joseph Goebbels</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>&quot;The people's community must not be a mere phrase, but a revolutionary achievement following from the radical
  carrying out of the basic life needs of the working class. A ruthless battle against corruption! A war against
  exploitation, freedom for the workers! The elimination of all economic-capitalist influences on national policy.
  Maintaining a rotten economic system has nothing to do with nationalism, which is an affirmation of the Fatherland.
  The sin of liberal thinking was to overlook socialism’s nation-building strengths, thereby allowing its energies to go
  in anti-national directions.&quot; - Joseph Goebbels</div>

<div>&quot;It would not be impossible to prove with sufficient repetition and a psychological understanding of the

<div>&quot;One always feels the need to wash one’s hands after being forced to deal with the methods of U.S.
  interventionism.
  It is so unpleasant and filthy that one shudders. When one hears the pious nonsense of the Jewish-led world plutocracy
  over the radio or reads it in the press, one need only to look behind the scenes to feel pity for the miseries of
  mankind. That such a man has the impudence to judge us, to call on God and the world as witnesses of the purity of his
  deeds, to incite war and send innocent people singing 'Onward Christian Soldiers' to battle for his filthy financial
  interests can only fill anyone with even the most primitive sense of decency with the deepest horror. Were there only
  such people in the world, one would have to despise humanity.&quot; - Joseph Goebbels [&rdquo;Mr. Roosevelt

<div>&quot;The woman is the teacher of the youth, and therefore the builder of the foundation of the future. If the

<div>&quot;Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to

<div>&quot;Nothing can now be believed which is seen in a newspaper. Truth itself becomes suspicious by being put into
  that polluted vehicle. The real extent of this state of misinformation is known only to those who are in situations to
  confront facts within their knowledge with the lies of the day. I will add, that the man who never looks into a
  newspaper is better informed than he who reads them; inasmuch as he who knows nothing is nearer to truth than he whose
  mind is filled with falsehoods &amp; errors. He who reads nothing will still learn the great facts, and the details
  are all false.&quot; - Thomas Jefferson</div>

<div><br /></div>
<div>&quot;Inundated via social media with the opinions of multitudes, users are diverted from introspection... These
  pressures weaken the fortitude required to develop and sustain convictions that can be implemented only by traveling a

<div>&quot;There is no joy equal to that of being able to work for all humanity and doing what you're doing well.&quot;
  - R.
  Buckminster Fuller</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>&quot;Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty - a beauty cold and austere, like
  that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or
  music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show.&quot; - Bertrand
  Russell</div>

  life.&quot; - John Stuart Mill</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>&quot;All silencing of discussion is an assumption of infallibility. Its condemnation may be allowed to rest on
  this common argument, not the worse for being common.&quot; - John Stuart Mill</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>&quot;For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert
  means
  for expanding its sphere of influence -- on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on
  intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has
  conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that
  combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations. Its preparations are
  concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No
  expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. It conducts the Cold War, in short, with a
  war-time discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match.&quot; - John F. Kennedy @(shortly before his
  assassination)</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>&quot;Life is suffering.</div>
<div>Love is the desire to see unnecessary suffering ameliorated.</div>
<div>Truth is the handmaiden of love.</div>
<div>Dialogue is the pathway to truth.</div>
<div>Humility is recognition of personal insufficiency and the willingness to learn.</div>
<div>To learn is to die voluntarily and to be born again, in great ways and small.</div>
<div>So, speech must be untrammeled, </div>
<div>so that dialogue can take place, </div>
<div>so that we can all humbly learn, </div>
<div>so that truth can serve love, </div>
<div>so that suffering can be ameliorated, </div>
<div>so that we can all stumble forward (so to speak) towards the kingdom of God.&quot; - Jordan Peterson</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>&quot;The worst form of stress is an absence of stress, because the feeling that there is no life before death

<div>&quot;Some say the I.D.W. is dangerous. But the only way you can construe a group of intellectuals talking to each

<div><br /></div>
<div>&quot;We are supposed to 'agree to disagree', a phrase now used indiscriminately as little more than a

  Lisa Nichols #affirmations</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>&quot;I am much more valuable to my family and to my community because I was willing to let them go; go through the
  door myself, teach myself, learn myself, condition myself, and then come back and get them. I'm much more valuable to
  them now. But I had to go through a window time of ten years of judgment. I had to allow my conviction to make me
  inconvenienced. See, we wanna grow, but we wanna all stay liked by everybody. I was willing to be my own rescue at the
  risk of your approval. I woke up and I liked myself today, so your like is extra. My job is to like me first. That's
  lonely, by the way. It's scary and it's lonely.&quot; - Lisa Nichols</div>

<div><br /></div>
<div>&quot;We curate our lives around this perceived sense of perfection, because we get rewarded in these short-term
  signals - hearts, likes, thumbs up - and we conflate that with value, and with conflate it with truth. And instead
  what it really is, is fake, brittle popularity, that is short term, and that leaves you even more - and admit it -
  vacant and empty than before you did it.&quot; - Chamath Palihapitiya, former FB executive</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>&quot;Part of our emergency is that it’s so tempting… to retreat to narrow arrogance, pre-formed positions, rigid

  and ambiguity and conflict and flux; it’s continually discovering new areas of personal ignorance and delusion.&quot;
  - David Foster Wallace</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>&quot;Disconfirming evidence - evidence that proves your existing ideas wrong - is exponentially more valuable than

<div>&quot;One of the grave difficulties in following a call is that it may feel utterly and hopelessly at odds with
  whatever we are trying to conserve, and this is always a moment of crisis, which means to separate, meaning that a

  untidy thing; it is a rope strung across the road at chest level.&quot; - Gregg Levoy</div>

<div>&quot;Our souls are not hungry for fame, comfort, wealth, or power. Those rewards create almost as many problems as

<div>&quot;It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of
  deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by
  dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort
  without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great
  devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and
  who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold
  and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.&quot; - Theodore Roosevelt</div>

<div>&quot;Every man, when he gets quiet, when he becomes desperately honest with himself, is capable of uttering
  profound truths. We all derive from the same source. There is no mystery about the origin of things. We are all part

  there.&quot; -Henry Miller</div>
<div><br /></div>

<div>&quot;The need for certainty is the greatest disease the mind faces.&quot; - Robert Greene</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>&quot;My formula for greatness in a human being is amor fati: that one wants nothing to be different, not forward,

  the face of what is necessary - but love it.&quot; - Friedrich Nietszche</div>

<div>He thinks of his enemy as the shadow that he himself casts.&quot; - Lao Tsu</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>&quot;People believe that there is a great conflict between good and evil. (...) The real conflict is between the

  all of the violence, abuse, and suffering, not only in society but also in the individual.&quot; - Don Miguel Ruiz

  preparation&quot; - Rilke
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>&quot;One thing about listening - generous listening - one really simple characteristic of it is that the generous
  listener is ready to be surprised. You go into [a conversation] with an assumption that you don’t know everything or
  understand everything, and you’re truly curious - which means you’re open to having whatever assumptions you do bring
  unsettled, and you’re going to be graceful about that and kind of curious about that when that happens.&quot; - Krista

<div><br /></div>
<div>&quot;A man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flows across his mind from within, more than
  the luster of the firmament of bards and sages. Yet he dismisses without notice his thought, because it is his. In
  every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated
  majesty.&quot; - Ralph Waldo Emerson [via Mastery pg 10]</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>&quot;You cannot convince people to love you. This is an absolute rule. No one will ever give you love because you

<div>&quot;The West won the world not by the superiority of its ideas or values or religion (to which few members of

<div>&quot;A deep sense of love and belonging is an irreducible need of all people. We are biologically, cognitively,
